# Musify

Musify is a full-stack web application designed for music streaming, playlist management, and music discovery.  
The platform allows users to create accounts, search and play songs, organize personalized playlists, and receive recommendations generated through a Python-based engine.  

The system is built with **React** for the frontend, **Java Spring Boot** for the backend, a **Python microservice** for recommendation processing, and **PostgreSQL** as the database.
